def extract_json_from_string(s):
    """
    This function takes a string that may contain a JSON object along with other text.
    It attempts to extract and decode the JSON object from the string.

    First, it checks if the entire string is a valid JSON. If it is, it immediately decodes and returns it.

    If the whole string is not valid JSON, it assumes that there is exactly one JSON object in the string 
    and that it's the largest substring that forms a valid JSON object. It attempts to find the start 
    and end of this JSON object by iteratively trying to decode the JSON from the start of the string 
    until it's successful, then from the end of the string backwards until it's successful.

    Note: This function may not work as expected if these assumptions are not met, 
    or if there are other substrings that can be parsed as JSON but are not the desired JSON object. 

    It is best used when you are confident in the structure of the input string and want a simple way 
    to extract a JSON object from it.
